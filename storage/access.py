        When a user creates a post, it'll be saved under his profile file as well

        reads fast. Note: the fully-serialized post is copied across followers'
        files (not just references, which would prompt unnecessary I/O reads).

        This function serializes the post and appends it to the following:

        - The author's "profile" file
        - Each followers' "timeline" file

        Marking a single post as "inactive" in a given file:

        posts are interacted with is lower than for newer posts)

        the user input (for active = True), then the active byte is overwritten
        to denote "False" and the function returns.

        entry in the file:
        - Serialize the provided values as a string according to the format
        with which posts are serialized.
