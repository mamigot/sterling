  - Tell backups to implement it (don't wait for their confirmation)
  - Process the request
  - Get back to the user with confirmation of completion

  - Add the request to requestQueue
  - Get back to the primary RM with confirmation of receipt (which allows
    the leader to remove it from its ledger)
  - (Another thread processes the requests on the requestQueue.)
